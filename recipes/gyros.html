		<h2>A Mediterranian Dish with Seasoned Lamb Meat and Pita Bread</h2>
			<p>Use a mixing bowl to ground lamb and beef along with many ingredients (onions, garlic, etc.) and mix until well combined. Place mixture onto a baking sheet and flatten evenly. Bake the dish in a preheated oven until nicely browned for 40 to 45 minutes, with an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees.</p>
			<p>Transfer the nicely finished dish onto a cutting board and cut the meat into 3 large sections, and cut horizontally into 1/8th strips to its end. Last but not least, put the meat strips in a well-oiled frying pan over medium heat, and cook the slices until browed, or 2 minuted per side.
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

			<li>1 pound ground beef</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>

			<li>Bake in oven until nicely browned, 40 to 45 minutes (instant-read thermometer placed in the center should read at least 160 degrees F).</li>
			<li>Cool to room temperature, transfer to a plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
			<li>Transfer meat to a cutting board. Cut into 3 pieces crosswise. Slice each piece into 1/8-inch thick slices as you need them.</li>
